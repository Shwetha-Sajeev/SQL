Assume you are given the table below on Uber transactions made by users. Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user. Output the user id, spend and transaction date.

SELECT 
  user_id,
  spend,
  transaction_date
FROM (
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    spend, 
    transaction_date, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS row_num
  FROM transactions) AS trans_num 
WHERE row_num = 3;

Alternative

WITH trans_num AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    spend, 
    transaction_date, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS row_num 
  FROM transactions)
 
SELECT 
  user_id, 
  spend, 
  transaction_date 
FROM trans_num 
WHERE row_num = 3;
