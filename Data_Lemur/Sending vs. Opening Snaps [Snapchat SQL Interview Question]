Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:

Calculate the following percentages:
time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

SELECT 
  age.age_bucket, 
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    SUM(activities.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activities.activity_type = 'send')/
      SUM(activities.time_spent),2) AS send_perc, 
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    SUM(activities.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activities.activity_type = 'open')/
      SUM(activities.time_spent),2) AS open_perc
FROM activities
INNER JOIN age_breakdown AS age 
  ON activities.user_id = age.user_id 
WHERE activities.activity_type IN ('send', 'open') 
GROUP BY age.age_bucket;

Alternative

WITH snaps_statistics AS (
  SELECT 
    age.age_bucket, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN activities.activity_type = 'send' 
      THEN activities.time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS send_timespent, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN activities.activity_type = 'open' 
      THEN activities.time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS open_timespent, 
    SUM(activities.time_spent) AS total_timespent 
  FROM activities
 INNER JOIN age_breakdown AS age 
    ON activities.user_id = age.user_id 
  WHERE activities.activity_type IN ('send', 'open') 
  GROUP BY age.age_bucket) 

SELECT 
  age_bucket, 
  ROUND(100.0 * send_timespent / total_timespent, 2) AS send_perc, 
  ROUND(100.0 * open_timespent / total_timespent, 2) AS open_perc 
FROM snaps_statistics;
