A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country than the person receiving the call.

What percentage of phone calls are international? Round the result to 1 decimal.

Assumption:

The caller_id in phone_info table refers to both the caller and receiver.

SELECT 
  ROUND(
    100.0 * SUM(CASE
      WHEN caller.country_id <> receiver.country_id THEN 1 ELSE NULL END)
    /COUNT(*) ,1) AS international_call_pct
FROM phone_calls AS calls
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS caller
  ON calls.caller_id = caller.caller_id
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS receiver
  ON calls.receiver_id = receiver.caller_id;


Alternative

SELECT 
  ROUND(
    100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (
      WHERE caller.country_id <> receiver.country_id) 
  / COUNT(*), 1) AS international_calls_pct
FROM phone_calls AS calls
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS caller
  ON calls.caller_id = caller.caller_id
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS receiver
  ON calls.receiver_id = receiver.caller_id;

Alternative

WITH international_calls AS (
SELECT 
  caller.caller_id, 
  caller.country_id,
  receiver.caller_id, 
  receiver.country_id
FROM phone_calls AS calls
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS caller
  ON calls.caller_id = caller.caller_id
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS receiver
  ON calls.receiver_id = receiver.caller_id
WHERE caller.country_id <> receiver.country_id
)

SELECT 
  ROUND(
    100.0 * COUNT(*)
  / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM phone_calls),1) AS international_call_pct
FROM international_calls;
