Find the number of Apple product users and the number of total users with a device and group the counts by language. Assume Apple products are only MacBook-Pro, iPhone 5s, and iPad-air. Output the language along with the total number of Apple users and users with any device. Order your results based on the number of total users in descending order.

SELECT 
    language,
    COUNT(DISTINCT 
          CASE 
              WHEN e.device IN ('macbook pro','iphone 5s','ipad air') THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL
          END) AS n_apple_user,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) AS n_total_users
FROM playbook_events e
JOIN playbook_users u USING(user_id)
GROUP BY u.language
ORDER BY n_total_users DESC
