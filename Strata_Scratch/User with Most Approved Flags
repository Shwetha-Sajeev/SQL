  (SELECT CONCAT(uf.user_firstname, ' ', uf.user_lastname) AS username,
          DENSE_RANK() OVER (
                             ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT video_id) DESC) AS rn
   FROM user_flags AS uf
   INNER JOIN flag_review AS fr ON uf.flag_id = fr.flag_id
   WHERE LOWER(fr.reviewed_outcome) = 'approved'
   GROUP BY username) AS inner_query
WHERE rn = 1
