Find the popularity percentage for each user on Meta/Facebook. The popularity percentage is defined as the total number of friends the user has divided by the total number of users on the platform, then converted into a percentage by multiplying by 100.
Output each user along with their popularity percentage. Order records in ascending order by user id.
The 'user1' and 'user2' column are pairs of friends.

SELECT user1, COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user1) FROM (SELECT user1 FROM facebook_friends UNION SELECT user2 FROM facebook_friends) AS users_union) * 100 AS popularity_percent
FROM (SELECT user1, user2 FROM facebook_friends UNION SELECT user2 AS user1, user1 AS user2 FROM facebook_friends) AS users_union
