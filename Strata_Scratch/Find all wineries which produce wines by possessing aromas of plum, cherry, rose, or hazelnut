Find all wineries which produce wines by possessing aromas of plum, cherry, rose, or hazelnut. To make it more simple, look only for singular form of the mentioned aromas. HINT: if one of the specified words is just a substring of another word, this should not be a hit, but a miss.


Example Description: Hot, tannic and simple, with cherry jam and currant flavors accompanied by high, tart acidity and chile-pepper alcohol heat.
Therefore the winery Bella Piazza is expected in the results.
