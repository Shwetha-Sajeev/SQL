You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

select h.hacker_id, h.name, sum(t1.scores) as total_scores from hackers h 
join (select s.hacker_id, s.challenge_id, max(s.score) scores from submissions s
group by s.hacker_id, s.challenge_id) as t1
on t1.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
group by h.hacker_id, h.name
having total_scores > 0
order by total_scores desc, h.hacker_id
