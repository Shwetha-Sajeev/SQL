A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

WITH T1 AS(
SELECT LAT_N, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS ranking
FROM STATION
)
SELECT ROUND(LAT_N, 4)
FROM T1
WHERE ranking = (SELECT CEIL(COUNT(ranking)/2) FROM T1)
