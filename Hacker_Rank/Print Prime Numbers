Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000 . Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand (&) character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime numbers <=10 would be:

2&3&5&7


WITH RECURSIVE odd_numbers (n) AS (
    SELECT 3
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 2 FROM odd_numbers WHERE n < 999
)
SELECT 
    CONCAT('2&', GROUP_CONCAT(n SEPARATOR '&'))
FROM odd_numbers AS list1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM odd_numbers AS list2
    WHERE list2.n < list1.n AND list1.n % list2.n = 0
);
